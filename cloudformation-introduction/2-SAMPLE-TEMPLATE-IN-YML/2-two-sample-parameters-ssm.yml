# In this template we are going to learn about usage of parameters
# Types: string, number, list, AWS specific type
# Use of the of the intrinsic function !Ref
# Specially about the AWS SSM parameter store integration with cloudformation
# Dependencies: This cloudformation template have a dependency on the SSM parameter store

Description: 'Cloudformation template to create EC2 instance' # --This is to desribe what the template is about
Parameters:  # --The parameter section is used to avoid hardcoding and to make the template [Dynamic]. [Indent [here] before starting next line]
  InstanceType: # --Enter [LogicalName] This InstanceType will be Ref in the resource section. [Indent [here] before starting next line]
      Description: WebServer EC2 instance type  # --This is to desribe what the parameter about
      Type: AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<String> # --Type here is using AWS Specific SSM parameter to store the instancetype in the parameterstore.
      Default: /jjtech/ec2/instancetype # --The InstanceType is stored using this link in the paramerstore and is being Ref here.
      # --To do this, go to ssm console --parameterstore and create parameter and put the instancetype in the value section.
      ConstraintDescription: must be a valid EC2 instance type.  # --A string that explains a constraint when the constraint is violated.
      # --For example, without a constraint description you will get error message that doesn't explains what the problem is.
  AMIID:   # --Enter [LogicalName] This InstanceType will be Ref in the resource section. [Indent [here] before starting next line]
    Description: The EC2 AMI id   # --This is to desribe what the parameter about

    Default: '/aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/amzn2-ami-hvm-x86_64-gp2' # --Using the latest AMIID link here makes the template more dynamic.
    # --one, it allowed you not to hardcode an amiid here and save you time from constantly having to change the AMIID every so often.
    # --To do this, go to ssm console --parameterstore and click on [Public parameters] --click on [Select a service]
    # --Select [ami-amazon-linux-latest] and then copy link for latest ami and paste here. And it is ready to Referenced [Ref].
